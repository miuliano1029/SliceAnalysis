# SliceAnalysis
This macro generates puncta density and colocalization analysis where it applies rolling ball background subtraction on each channel, then makes/saves binary masks of each image and the puncta ROIs for each. It saves an excel file including average puncta area, area per whole image, area per 100um2, total number of puncta and total number per 100um2. These data can then be used for manual colocalization.
